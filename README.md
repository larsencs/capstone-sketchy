# Looks Sketchy
Looks Sketchy is a drawing prompt generator that generates prompts in a Cards-Against-Humanity-Style fashion based on the user's current mood, and provides a place for the user to both save the generated prompts as well as what they're inspired to produce.
# Description
## Why Looks Sketchy was created
The internet is full of websites that offer drawing prompts, and I don't know an artist that hasn't tried to draw from a prompt or two at some point. The problem with all of those prompt sites is the prompts are static, and are very often at odds with the artist's current mood. Looks Sketchy was designed to change that up.
## Features
<ol>
  <li>Looks Sketchy allows the user to input their current mood ...even when that mood is a messy conglomerate of different feelings.</li>
  <li>Looks Sketchy has two different manners of operation: Mundane and Madness. The Mundane side will deliver a random, pre-written prompt based upon the user's given mood, while the Madness option will select several different pre-written prompts and join them together with another, randomly selected sentence fragment.</li>
  <li>Looks Sketchy saves all of the open prompts (and their mood at the time of selection) on the user dashboard allowing the user to dig into the prompts that they want to complete without losing track of previous prompts.</li>
